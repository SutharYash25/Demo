/* Create a class named 'Member' having the following members:
Data members 
Name

Phone number
Address 5 - Salary
It also has a method named 'printSalary' which prints the salary of the 
members.
Two classes 'Employee' and 'Manager' inherits the 'Member' class. The 
'Employee' and 'Manager' classes have data members 'specialization' and 
'department' respectively. Now, assign name, age, phone number, 
address and salary to an employee and a manager by making an object of 
both of these classes and print the same.*/
